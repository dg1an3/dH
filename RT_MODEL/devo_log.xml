	<summary>adaptive beamlet rep test</summary>
	<locus>Beam.cpp; Histogram.cpp</locus>
	<changes>
	added function to compute adapted beamlets in Beam.cpp
added function to resample regions for dVolumes, if the dVolumes are adapted
adaptive gridding --> computing binomial filter 1d and filtering along x-axis, then decimating
</changes>
	<result>
	just filtering w/o resampling --> results were comparable to without filtering
w/ resampling --> degradation in quality
</result>
	<conclusion>
	change in quality with resampling may be due to reduction in number of counts in histograms (i.e. sampling error in intensity domain)
to test, followed up with experiment to increase sigma for G0 and G1.  also, changed tolerance for G0 and G1 to reflect this.
	this improves result somewhat, but does not completely offset the quality issues
for 3d case, it could be that the number of samples will offset this, and it will provide performance benefits while maintaining quality
for now, the code for adaptive beamlets will be placed in #define blocks
</conclusion>
