	How to handle draw lists, when a draw list may be used for both opaque and transparent rendering

		-> draw list to describe the opaque parts (lines, opaque)
			DescribeOpaque

		-> draw list to describe the surface (opaque or transparent, depending on CRenderable's alpha value)
			DescribeAlpha


	To actually render
		-> For each CRenderable,
			Call DescribeOpaque for each (or call list Opaque)

		-> For each CRenderable w/ an alpha value > max_alpha
			Call DescribeAlpha for each (or call list Alpha) w/ blending set OFF

		-> For each CRenderable w/ an alpha value < max_alpha, sorted by centroid
			Call DescribeAlpha for each w/ 
				blending ON
				depth buffer write OFF
				front face transparent (culling)
				back face material set to no lighting effects
		
		-> For each CRenderable w/ an alpha value < max_alpha, sorted by centroid
			Call DescribeAlpha for each w/ 
				blending ON
				depth buffer write ON
				front face transparent (culling)
				back face material set to no lighting effects
		
		-> For each CRenderable w/ an alpha value < max_alpha, sorted by centroid
			Call DescribeAlpha for each w/ 
				blending ON
				depth buffer write OFF
				front face material set with lighting effects
				back face transparent
		
		-> For each CRenderable w/ an alpha value < max_alpha, sorted by centroid
			Call DescribeAlpha for each w/ 
				blending ON
				depth buffer write ON
				front face material set with lighting effects
				back face transparent
