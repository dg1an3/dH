This directory contains a Visual Studio project (VecMat.dsp) and header files for several template classes that represent vector and matrices.

The directory TestvecMat also contains a Visual studio project and workspace (TestVecMat.dsw and TestVecMat.dsp) that can be used to build a simple test application for the classes.

TODO:

1) Move header files to the include subdirectory

2) Check new normalization for matrices
